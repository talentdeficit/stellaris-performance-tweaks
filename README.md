# some stellaris mods to customize the game to my preferences

## included

* ai-tweaks
  prevents non-void dweller ai empires from researching habitats and
  non-doorway ai empires from researching gateway construction so the late game
  isn't filled with construction ships spamming habs and gateways -- both things
  that add substantial lategame lag

## is this available on the steam workshop or paradox mod thing?

no. someone can go ahead and publish it if they like. it's MIT licensed
